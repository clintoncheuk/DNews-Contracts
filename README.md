# DNews Smart Contract

A decentralized news platform that stores news articles, images, videos on Arweave and write the URL to the blockchain.

## Frontend

The frontend of the smart contract can be found [here](https://github.com/clintoncheuk/DNews-Contracts).

## Incentive

To incentivize people to publish news on the decentralized news platform, 10 DNews tokens will be awarded per news article, the amount will be adjustable in the smart contract.

## Coping With False Information

There is an upvote and downvote count for each news article, if the downvote count is significantly greater than the upvote count, the news article will be hidden in the frontend, but be still on the blockchain.
